# How To Develop, Build, Dockerize and Run MERN Stack on Docker Compose — Typescript Version
MERN Stack uses four technologies such as MongoDB, Express, React, and NodeJS. React is a javascript library for building web apps and it doesn’t load itself in the browser. We need some kind of mechanism that loads the index.html (single page) of React application with all the dependencies(CSS and js files) in the browser. In this case, we are using node as the webserver which loads React assets and accepts any API calls from the React UI app.
